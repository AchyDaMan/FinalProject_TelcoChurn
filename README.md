Using this data set from IBM we will be exploring what factors result in costumers being more likely to churn. Some research questions we will focus on include; what type of contract keeps coustumers coming back? Does service add ons affect how long costumers stay with the company if so is one of the services underperforming causing higher rates of churn? The data that we will use is the IBM sample Telco dataset. Our hypothesis is that variables associated with previous usage will likely predict future churn, indicating that coustumers are less likely to churn after a certain period of time using the service. Our proposed methods include linear regression to test relationship between variables, and a probability test to determine the likelihood of a variety of reasons for churn to see what causes customers to not return. Potential uses in the future include churn as a business concern, more customers who are satisfied and keep investing in this business. Predicting churn will help retain the customer base, keep them happy enough, maximize profits by only offering incentives to customers likely to churn.
